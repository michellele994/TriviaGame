# TriviaGame
This project was a homework due for the Trilogy & University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This project was intended to hone my skills in
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery

The homework for this project instructed me to construct a timed trivia game.
 1. Click "Start!" to begin round of questions with a timer.
 2. Each question must be set with a timer that will run out if a player does not choose an answer
 3. The game must keep score of right and wrong answers.
 4. When the round of question ends, provide a summary of the player's results.
 5. Allow the player to restart the game without refreshing the page.
